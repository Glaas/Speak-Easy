# Speak-Easy
A minimalistic dialogue system for Unity


## Instructions
You can install this package in two ways.
### A) Package Manager (GIT Url)
The suggested way to install this package is through the Unity's Package Manager itself, via a GIT url. This way, you will be notified once new versions get released, and you will be able to download them directly from the Unity Editor.

-> **The GIT url you need to add to the Package manager is the following** (copy and paste it): **https://github.com/Glaas/Speak-Easy.git**

For more info on how to install custom packages from a GIT Url, please read here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

*P.S. If you want, you can also use the GIT url from other branches or other forked repositories.\
Example with the "dev" branch: https://github.com/Glaas/Speak-Easy.git#develop*

### B) Manual Install
You can also install this package manually, by copying the source files directly into your project's assets folder. (You'd have to do this every time there is a new update.)

### Setup

For detailed information about setup, please check out the [documentation](https://radweb.notion.site/Speak-Easy-cccef60ba0b04c7684d3650fe5a266d0)
